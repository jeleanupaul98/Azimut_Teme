        <h1> Michio Kaku</h1>
        <ul class="lista">
            <li>Remember the movie ‘The Matrix,’ where virtual information popped up to help inform physical day-
                to-day reality? Such things won’t always be the stuff of Hollywood. If the Internet is accessible via
                contact lenses, biographies will appear next to the faces of the people we talk to, and we will see
                subtitles if they speak a foreign language.</li>
            <li>If a Martian came down to Earth and watched television, he’d come to conclusion that all the world’s
                society is based on Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. He’d be amazed that our society hasn’t
                collapsed.</li>
            <li>Some advice: keep the flame of curiosity and wonderment alive, even when studying for boring
                exams. That is the well from which we scientists draw our nourishment and energy. And also, learn
                the math. Math is the language of nature, so we have to learn this language.</li>
            <li>Our grandkids will lead the lives of the gods of mythology. Zeus could think and move objects
                around. We’ll have that power. Venus had a perfect, timeless body. We’ll have that, too. Pegasus
                was a flying horse. We’ll be able to modify life in the future.</li>
            <li>Sooner or later, we will face a catastrophic threat from space. Of all the possible threats, only a
                gigantic asteroid hit can destroy the entire planet. If we prepare now, we better our odds of survival.
                The dinosaurs never knew what hit them.</li>
            <li>Climate change is the 800-pound gorilla in the living room that the media dances around. But in the
                scientific community, it’s a settled question: 95 percent of scientists believe this is happening with
                100 percent confidence temperatures are rising./li>
            <li>One day I went up to my mom and I said, ‘Mom, can I have permission to build a 2.3-million
                electron-volt atom smasher – a betatron – in the garage?’ And my mom stared at me, and she said,
                ‘Sure. Why not? And don’t forget to take out the garbage.’
                When I was 16 years old, I assembled a 2.3 million electron volt beta particle accelerator. I went to
                Westinghouse, I got 400 pounds of translator steel, 22 miles of copper wire, and I assembled a 6-
                kilowatt, 2.3 million electron accelerator in the garage.</li>
            <li>Aging is basically the build-up of error: error at the genetic level, error at the cellular level. Cells
                normally repair themselves; that’s why you heal when you get a cut. But even the mechanism of
                repair eventually falls apart.</li>
            <li>Leaders in China and India realize that science and technology lead to success and wealth. But
                many countries in the West graduate students into the unemployment line by teaching skills that
                were necessary to live in 1950.</li>
            <li>There’s no reason why we cannot become smarter, more perfect, and maybe even live longer.</li>
